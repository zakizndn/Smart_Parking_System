# Smart Parking System
ECE2216 - Microcontroller and Microprocessor Systems

Description: 
 
Finding available parking space is a persistent problem especially in the urban areas. To overcome this problem, numerous parking space information systems have been deployed to inform the drivers on the availability of parking spaces. As the information is usually displayed at the entrance or inside the parking zones, it is usually too late for the drivers as they are already arriving at the parking zones. As a result, the drivers have to either wait for parking spaces at the car park or they have to go to other parking zones which may still leads to the same problem.
